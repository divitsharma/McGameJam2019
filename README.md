    - Heal : Low health and high mobility.
        - Ranged hero.
         -Heal (health regeneration spell targeted to a nearby ally)
        - Resurrect (brings an ally back from the dead)
    - The Hook: High health and high mobility. Villian.
        - Hook
            - Hit wall to pull towards it
        - Hit hero to damage them and pull them in
- All abilities are subject to independent cooldowns and mana costs.
- The map is randomly generated. It has different assets (Crates, barrels)
- Weapons will appear randomly around the map as well as power ups (mana regen) that are applied to the hero that picks it up.
