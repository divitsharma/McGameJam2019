# Game Idea:

- 3 vs. 1 platform game.
- Each character has its own specialties and its set of three abilities:
    - Tank : High health and low mobility. Melee hero.
        - Block (attack or hook)
        - Stun
        - Dash
    - Heal : Low health and high mobility. Ranged hero.
        - Heal (health regeneration spell targeted to a nearby ally)
        - Resurrect (brings an ally back from the dead)
        - Debuff (remove slow, stun, poison status ...)
    - DPS : Medium health and medium mobility Attack type depends on the weapon used.
        - DPS has 3 weapon slots. He will move around the map to pick up weapons and will switch between the ones he has.
    - Hook : High health and high mobility. Melee hero.
        - Hook (pull a hero close to you)
        - Stun
        - AOE melee Attack
- All abilities are subject to independent cooldowns and mana costs.
- The map is randomly generated. It has different assets (like holes, walls ...)
- Weapons will appear randomly around the map as well as power ups (mana regen) that are applied to the hero that picks it up.
